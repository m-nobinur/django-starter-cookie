## Local Development

>‚ùó Make sure you've python3, pip and node installed on your machine.

- To check your machine meets all the requirements run the following command:
  
```bash
source ./utils/scripts/precheck.sh
```

- Create a folder where to clone the project and cd into it.

```bash
mkdir <folder-name>
```

Install a virtual environment manager if not installed yet. We will use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

1. For installing pipenv run:

    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    ```

1. Now clone the project and navigate to `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}` folder.

    ```bash
    git clone <project-github-link>
    ```

1. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```

1. Install all the local dependencies for the project

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements/local.txt

    npm install
    ```

1. Make sure to be in the project's root directory and run the following command

    ```bash
    export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE={{ cookiecutter.project_name }}.settings.local

    python ./utils/scripts/autoenv.py
    ```

1. Now run the following command

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

1. Now create a superuser

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

1. To run tailwind jit compiler, start a new terminal session and run

    > Make sure you are in project's root folder.

    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./static/sass/input.css -o ./static/css/default__main.css
    ```

1. If all gone well you can now start the server

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

1. Now your site is ready to visit. Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/] and start hacking.

> We have created some scripts to automate the process and some aliases to make the development process easier. These scripts are located in the `utils/scripts` folder.

To use the aliases and scripts run the following command

```bash
source ./utils/scripts/main.sh
```

Now we can just run the following commands to start the development server

```bash
env; mrun
```

## Basic Commands

If you've sourced the main script, then the following command will be available:
